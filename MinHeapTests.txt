    not sure how to test this





OPTIMISATION:

Conditions to check in this order: 
    - Rides are within 10 minutes of each other () [Act as a stopping condition]
    - Passenger totals less or eqaul to 6 (Ride1.Count + Ride 2.Count <= 6)
    - Start and end IDs are the same (Ride1.StartID == Ride2.StartID && Ride1.End  Ride2.End)
    
If Meet:
Insert New Ride
Remove old rides

Questions:
Do we first need to check if the ride ID is unique, or do we assume they are unique?
