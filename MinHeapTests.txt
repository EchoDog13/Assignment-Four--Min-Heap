OPTIMISATION:

Conditions to check in this order: 
    - Rides are within 10 minutes of each other () [Act as a stopping condition]
    - Passenger totals less or eqaul to 6 (Ride1.Count + Ride 2.Count <= 6)
    - Start and end IDs are the same (Ride1.StartID == Ride2.StartID && Ride1.End  Ride2.End)
    
If Meet:
Insert New Ride
Remove old rides

OPTIMISATION Tests:

optomise empty heap
optomise heap with one item
optomise successfully with multiple items

optimise three rides  2 people eachwithin 10 minutes
optimise two ride, 7 people totals

optimise rides with different locations IDs
optomise ride with same location items
